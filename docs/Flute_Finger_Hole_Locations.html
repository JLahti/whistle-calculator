<h2>Flute Finger Hole Locations</h2>

Determining approximate finger hole locations for a simple
6 hole flute is somewhat complicated.  Much of what follows
is due to the analysis of A. H. Benade (see "Fundamentals
of Musical Acoustics," A. H. Benade, Oxford Univ Press, or
"The Physics of Musical Instruments," N. H. Fletcher and
T. D. Rossing, Springer-Verlag.)
<p>
The wavelength of the sound produced is determined by the
flute tube and tone holes.  For a pipe of length L, open at both ends,
and ignoring end effects, the wavelength of the sound is
twice the length of the tube.  The frequency produced is
given by dividing the speed of sound (345 m/s) by the wavelength.
</p><p>
The method described here is to estimate an effective length
for a real (cylindrical) tube taking into account end effects,
the size of the tone holes, etc.
</p><p>
If the fundamental (all tone holes closed) corresponds to
an effective length L<sub>eo</sub>, then the desired effective
lengths for a six (or fewer) hole flute to produce notes of
the (Western major) scale are given by:

<p>
The actual physical length of the flute will be shorter than L<sub>eo</sub>
and the distance to the tone holes (from the blow end) will be shorter
than the values calculated in the table.
</p><p>
As described by Benade, the end effects (at both the blow hole and
at the first open hole) act (approximately) as an additional length
which must be subtracted from the calculated effective lengths to
get the physical lengths desired.  As long as you don't deviate too
much from typical flute proportions, these approximate calculations
should get you pretty close.  If you are serious about getting your
flute in tune, plan on making at least two flutes.
</p><p>
First, make your flute with no tone holes and adjust the length
to match the desired lowest note.  The blow hole is typically
1/2 to 2/3 the tube's inner diameter, and the stopper will be
about an equal distance from the center of the blow hole.
Then get out your ruler and measure the following:<br>
</p><ul>
t = wall thickness of the tube<br>
L<sub>o</sub> = length of the tube from the center of the blow hole
to the open end.<br>
a = inside radius of tube (2a = inside diameter), and<br>
d = distance from center of blow hole to stopper (see below)
</ul>
Then,<br>
<ul>
L<sub>eo</sub> = (L<sub>b</sub> + L<sub>o</sub> + 0.6 a)<br>
where<br>
0.6 a = approximate end correction at the open end and <br>
L<sub>b</sub> is the length correction at the blow end, which
is not known.
</ul>
<p>
L<sub>b</sub> can be determined approximately by:<br>
</p><ul>
b = radius of blow hole<br>
H<sub>eff</sub> = (t+1.7b) <br>
L<sub>b</sub> = H<sub>eff</sub>  (1 - e) (a/b)<sup>2</sup> <br>
<ul>
where e = fraction of blow hole covered by the player's lip<br>
e is typically 0.25 to 0.33
</ul>
Note: using a single L<sub>b</sub> for all notes is a reasonable
approximation IF d is close to 0.37 L<sub>b</sub><br>
</ul>


Now use your value of L<sub>eo</sub> and the table above to get
desired effective lengths for each of the hole positions, measured from
the center of the blow hole to the center of the tone hole.  Call
these L<sub>ei</sub> where "i" corresponds to the first column
in the table. (e.g. L<sub>e1</sub> = 8/9 L<sub>eo</sub>, etc).
From each L<sub>ei</sub>, subtract (L<sub>b</sub>&nbsp;+&nbsp;0.6a)
to get your first approximate hole positions, L<sub>i</sub>.
<p>
The actual position for each hole will depend on the tone hole
size and the position of any other open tone holes.  Hence, you
have some leeway to choose one or the other of these.  Smaller
tone holes will give a mellower sound and larger holes give
a brighter (and louder) sound.  Your holes do not need to be
all the same size, so it is possible to make some choices
which affect the ergonomics of your flute.  Below I will assume
that all the tone holes are fixed in size, and only their
positions are to be adjusted.  If this results in
tone hole positions which are uncomfortable (or unusable) then
adjust one or more of the tone hole sizes and recompute.
</p><p>
Now compute the first corrections:<br>
</p><ul>
L<sub>i</sub><sup>new</sup> = L<sub>ei</sub>
- L<sub>b</sub> - L<sub>c</sub>
</ul>
where
<ul>
if i = 1 (for Re) then
<ul>
L<sub>c</sub> = (t+1.5b)/( (b/a)<sup>2</sup> + (t+1.5b)/D )<br>
where D = L<sub>o</sub> - L<sub>1</sub><br>
</ul>
else (for all other holes)
<ul>
L<sub>c</sub> = s [ ( 1 + 2(1.5b + t)
(a/b)<sup>2</sup> /s )<sup>1/2</sup>
 - 1 ]
</ul>
where
<ul>
b = tone hole radius (2b = diameter) of first open hole from the blow end,<br>
s = 1/2 of the spacing between first and second open holes from the blow end<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;[i.e. s = ( L<sub>i-1</sub> - L<sub>i</sub> )/2 ]
</ul>
endif
</ul>

<p>
For each of these calculations, you will need to repeat them
several times.  For example, for the first tone hole, an initial
value of D is used which was computed from the previous
approximate positions.  Once the correction is found, compute the
new value of D and recompute the correction.  Continue until
the answer doesn't change much.  For the other holes, recompute
s using the corrected position to obtain a better correction.
Do this one hole at a time.  If you correct all the holes, then
go back and redo the calculations for all the holes, you can
get into numerical trouble in some cases.
</p><p>
Now drill your holes.  If a note is a bit flat, you can enlarge the
first open hole (from the blow end) a bit to sharpen it.  If you
drill your holes a little small to begin with, you might be able
to bring your flute into tune without having to make a second one.
</p><p>
Note: if you have particular thick walls on your flute (like some
wood flutes) you will need to add another correction.  Use
</p><ul>
L<sub>i</sub> = L<sub>ei</sub> - L<sub>b</sub> - L<sub>c</sub> - L<sub>t</sub>
</ul>
where<br>
<ul>
L<sub>t</sub> =  t (b/a)<sup>2</sup> /4 times the number of closed holes between the first open
hole and the blow end.
</ul>
You will also need to shorten your tube a bit as the presence of the
closed holes will flatten the fundamental as well.
<p>
Now check the tuning of your flute, and estimate adjustments to make
your second flute.  That is, if your note is 3% flat, move the hole
3% closer to the blow hole, etc.  A frequency counter is best for this,
but if necessary, you can do it "by ear" (e.g. by comparing to
another instrument which is in tune and listening to the beats).
If you see systematic problems (e.g. Re is a little flat, Me a little
flatter, and by the time you get to Ti it is very flat) then your
value of L<sub>b</sub> can be adjusted to fix all the holes at once.
</p><p>
For a fipple flute (e.g. a recorder) the correction at the mouth
can be approximated by
</p><ul>
L<sub>b</sub> = 2.3 a<sup>2</sup> / (area of fipple opening)<sup>1/2</sup>
</ul>
though this is only a rough approximation.
