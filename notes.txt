Open Bugs:
- Constants do not change value when switching units

Fixed Bugs:
- The change flag is set by the embouchure dialog when no changes were made.
- Update lower frame after configuration.

Future features:
1. Support for symmetric and arbitrary conical bores.
2. Automatically fudging the output to support lower keys.
3. Different/arbitrary temperaments
4. Automatic hole sizing according to ergonomic parameters
5. Export to DXF and/or GCODE
6. Consolidate changing units into the data_store.

The reason that the message handler exists is that the tkinter message
handler does not have a mechanism to send messages to anything but a widget
and then there is no way to send the same message to multiple widgits.

The problem that this one solves is that there are a couple of controls in
the main window that need to cause everything else in the window to update.
One example of this is when the units are changed from inch to metric.
Every widgit that carries a measurement of some kind needs to be updated and
some of them are harder to change than others, so they all need their own
method to do that.

This event handler is very dumb. When a event is invoked, every handler
that has registered for the event is invoked in the order that it was
registered. This is done synchronously. It is perfectly okay for one event
handler to to raise another event, however, there is no checking to see
if there is a circular event chain. Event chains should be short. It is
unwise to depend on the order that they are run.

The events and handlers are kept in a global list in the utilities module,
along with the code that manages it.

Convert farenheit to celsius
C = (F - 32) / 1.8
Celsius to Kelvin
K = C + 273.15
Speed of sound in M/s = math.pow(401.66 * K, 0.5)
