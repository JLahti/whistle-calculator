# Whistle Calculator
This is a robust and flexible calculator used to place the tone holes in a whistle or flute. 

It is written in Python and the only dependencies should be Python3 and Tkinter. It will operate under any operating system that supports these.

The Makefile can make a stand-alone executable, or it can be used by running the main.py. For example, `python3 main.py`

There are stand-alone executables in the "binaries" directory. Currently only Windows and Linux are supported. If you need Apple support, let me know and maybe we can work something out. Since I don't have any Apple products, I cannot just build it and upload it here.
